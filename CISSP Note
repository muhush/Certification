1. Security and Risk Management
  A. Security Fundamentals
    1) The five pillars of information security
    2) Confidentiality - sensitive information, encryption, steganography
    3) Integrity - Hash, changes in hash values, digital signatures (Authenticity, Non-repudiation), digital certificates
    4) Availability - patching
    5) Authenticity and nonrepudiation - physical signature, digital signature, bio-security, video surveillance
  B. Security Governance
    1) Aligning security with the business - security leader, business leader, security professionals  *unbalanced decisions
    2) Organizational processes
    3) Security roles and responsibilities - Due Care (legal responsibilities), Due Diligence (reasonable measures), 
    4) Control and risk frameworks - COBIT (Control Objectives for IT, Audit), ISO Standards (IT control), NIST 800-53, NIST RMF (800-37), FedRAMP, SABSA
        While COBIT focuses more on aligning IT management with business objectives and governance,
        ISO standards provide specific requirements for maintaining information security management quality and consistency across industries globally.

  C. Compliance and Ethics
    1) Legal and compliance risks - GDPR, PCI DSS
    2) Data privacy - PII (Identifiable), PHI (Health), GAPP(Accept Privacy, AICPA, CICA, ISACA, IIA)
    3) GDPR - E.U regulations, anyone in E.U geolocation
    4) California privacy law - CPRA (SPI = Sensitive)
    5) National data privacy laws - PIPL(China), PPIA (South Africa)
    6) Computer crimes - CFAA (Access), ECPA (network communication), ITADA (Identity)
    7) Software Licensing - SLA, ELAs (Enterprise), EULAs
    8) Intellectual Property - Copyrights, Trademarks, Patents(protect inventions)
    9) Import and export controls - ITAR (defense articles), EAR (dual use), OFAC (Sansation)
    10) Data breaches    * Encryption is easy to protect data breach
    11) Ethics    * ISC2 members are required to report breaches of the Code of Ethics to ISC2 for investigation
  D. Security Policy
    1) Security policy framework - policies > standard (details) > guidelines (advice),  procedures    * Policy, standards, and procedures are mandatory. Guidelines are optional
    2) Security Policies
  E. Business Continuity
    1) Business continuity planning - BIA (Business Impact Assessment, identifies and prioritizes)    
      * BCP is also known as continuity of operations planning (COOP), BCP in the cloud is a partnership between providers and customers
    2) Business continuity controls - Single Point of Failure Analysis, Contingency Plan
    3) High availability (Multi-system, minimal interrupt) and fault tolerance (Single system) - load balancing (work evenly)
        Component redundancy - such as power supply or fan
        clustering - all active working
        RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks) = Disk mirroring (RAID 1), Disk Striping (RAID 5)
        * RAID is a fault-tolerance technique, not a backup state
  F. Personnel Security
    1) Personnel security - strong security policy, insider threat
    2) Security in the hiring process - Employment Agreements, NDAs
    3) Employee termination process - Exit interview, Revoke Access Promptly
    4) Employee privacy - minimization, limit access, encryption, masking (hiding)
    5) Social networking - multi-factoring
  G. Risk Management
    1) Risk analysis, assessment, and scope    * Threat vectors are the specific methods that threats use to exploit a vulnerability
    2) Quantitative risk assessment 
      - single risk and asset pair, Asset Value(AV), Exposure Factor(EF), Single-Loss Expectancy(SLE)
      - AV * EF = SLE
      - Annualized Rate of Occurrence(ARO), Annualized Loss Expectancy(ALE),
      - SLE * ARO = ALE
      * Be prepared to work through a quantitative risk assessment calculation on the exam
      - Mean Time to Failure(MTTF), Mean Time Between Failure(MTBF), Mean Time to Repair(MTTR)
    3) Risk treatment - Inherent Risk => controls applied => residual risk + control risk, Expansionary/Neutral/Conservative
    4) Security control selection and implementation - Defense in Depth    
      * Technical controls are implemented by technology while operational controls are implemented by people!
    5) Continuous monitoring, measurement, and tuning
    6) Risk management frameworks - NIST 800-37 (categorize, select, implement, assess, authorize, monitor)
    7) Risk visibility and reporting
  H. Threat Modeling
    1) Threat intelligence - Open-source intelligence, Email Address Harvesting
    2) Managing threat indicators -CybOX, STIX, TAXII, OpenIOC
    3) Intelligence sharing -ISACs
    4) Threat research
    5) Identifying threats - structured approach
    6) Automating threat intelligence - Data Enrichment
    7) Threat hunting
  I. Supply Chain Risk Management
    1) Managing vendor relationships
    2) Vendor agreements - SLRs, SLA, MOU, MOA, BPA
    3) Vendor information management
    4) Cloud audits - SOC1(assurance), SOC2(detailed), SOC3 (high-level), Type I report(control), Type II report(testing), SSAE 18, ISAE 3402
  J. Awareness and Training
    1) Security awareness training
    2) Compliance training
    3) User habits
    4) Measuring compliance and security
