-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Security Architecture and Engineering
  A. Secure Design
    1) Secure design principles
      - Fail open, Fail secure
      % Network segmentation involves dividing a network into smaller parts to improve security and manageability, 
        but it doesn't directly prevent programs from accessing each other.
      % Process isolation is a security measure that ensures different programs run separately,
        preventing them from accessing or interfering with each other.
    2) Security models
      - Bell-LaPadula Model(confidentiality, No read up, no write down), Biba Model(integrity, no read down, no write up)
      * The Bell-LaPadula model is rarely implemented outside of military applications
      * The Bell-LaPadula model and Biba models are important for the exam but rarely used in the real world
    3) Security evaluation models
      - TCSEC, Common Criteria, Certification and Accreditation(ATO, IATO, IATT, DATO)
      * Certification and accreditation are different. Accreditation and authorization are the same.
    4) Segregation of duties
      % Segregation of duties is the principle that ensures no individual has access to multiple permissions
        that would allow them to perform a highly sensitive action alone, preventing fraud and errors.
      % Two-person control is a security measure that requires at least two authorized individuals to perform certain actions,
        ensuring that no single person can complete sensitive tasks alone.
    5) Privacy by design
      (1) Proactive preventive
      (2) Privacy as the Default Setting
      (3) Privacy Embedded into Design
      (4) Full Functionality
      (5) End to End security
      (6) Visibility and Transparency
      (7) Respect for User Privacy
    6) Secure defaults
      - Keep It Simple and Small
    7) Information system lifecycle
  B. Virtualization and Cloud Computing
    1) What is the cloud?
    2) Cloud computing roles
      - Cloud Access Security Broker(CASB)
    3) Drivers for cloud computing
      - On-demand self-service, Scalability, Elasticity, Broad Network Access, Measured Service
    4) Security service providers
      * MSSPs(Managed Security Service Providers) may also be referred to as security as a service (SECaaS)
      - Network-based CASB, API-Based CASB
    5) Multitenant computing
      - Oversubscription, Resource Pooling
    6) Virtualization
      - Type 1, Type 2(Operating system, personal device), VM Sprawl
      % Type 1 hypervisor is known as bare metal and runs on top of bare hardware.
      % Type 2 hypervisor is known as hosted and runs on top of an operating system.
    7) Desktop and application virtualization
      - VDI(Virtual Desktop Infrastructure), Application Virtualization
    8) Cloud compute resources
    9) Containerization
      - Applications are what containerized computing environments are created for.
      % A hypervisor is not part of containerization. A hypervisor is an application where you can create, manage, and run multiple VMs.
    10) Cloud activities and the cloud reference architecture
      - ISO/IEC 17789:2014
      * Reference architectures provide a useful framework, but they're just a starting point.
    11) Cloud deployment models
      * No cloud model is inherently superior to the other approaches. It all depends on the context.
      % Vertical scaling adds more resources to existing servers to meet demand.
      % Horizontal scaling adds more servers to the pool to meet increased demand.
    12) Cloud service categories
      - XaaS, SaaS(entire app / Data), PaaS(app platform / Data, Application), IaaS(Servers/storage / Data, Application, OS), FaaS(serverless computing)
      * Understanding the shared responsibility model is crucial for cybersecurity professionals.
    13) Edge and fog computing
  C. Hardware Security

    3) Distributed and high-performance computing
      - Large-Scale Parallel Data, Grid Computing, Peer-to-peer Computing(Tor)
      % Grid computing utilizes the unused processing power of multiple computers across different locations,
        combining them to form a virtual supercomputer that is managed by a centralized controller.
  E. Embedded Systems Security
    1) Industrial control systems and operational technology
      - SCADA(Remote Central), DCS(Controlling processes), PLC
      % SCADA is used to gather information from remote sensors via telemetry.
      % Distributed Control System (DCS) is used to control industrial processes.
      % Programmable Logic Controller (PLCs) is a device used to monitor and control industrial equipment.
    2) Internet of things
    3) Securing smart devices
      - Firmware Version Control, Security Wrapper
    4) Secure networking for smart devices
      * Network segmentation is the most important control for embedded devices

      - RTOSs(Real-time), CAN bus
    6) Communications for embedded devices
  F. Encryption
    1) Understanding encryption
    2) Symmetric and asymmetric cryptography
      - Symmetric(same key), Asymmetric(different key, public, private)
      * Keys used to encrypt and decrypt using asymmetric cryptography must be from the same pair
    3) Goals and cryptography
      - Confidentiality, Integrity, Authentication, Obfuscation(hiding), Non-Repudiation
    4) Codes and ciphers
      * Codes and ciphers are related concepts, but you should know the difference when you take the exam
      - Stream Ciphers, Block Ciphers
    5) Cryptographic math
      - Exclusive Or(XOR), 
      - Confusion, Defusion, Obfuscation
    6) Choosing encryption algorithms
       * Don't try to build your own encryption algorithm unless you really know what you're doing
    7) The perfect encryption algorithm
       - One-Time pad
       % Securely exchanging the pads is essential for the security of one-time pad operations, 
         as interception by a third party could compromise the security of the encrypted messages.
       % Using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) in conjunction with the one-time pad is not critical to the security of one-time pad operations,
         as the one-time pad's security is already absolute if implemented correctly.
    8) The cryptographic lifecycle
  G. Symmetric Cryptography
    1) Data encryption standard(DES) - 64bit blocks, 54bit length
    2) 3DES
      * Double DES is no more secure than standard DES, due to the meet-in-the-middle attack
      - 64-bit block, 112-bit length
    3) AES, Blowfish, and Twofish
      - Rihndael algorithm, 128-bit blocks, 128, 192, 256 bits lengths
      - Blowfish = 64 bit blocks, 32~448 bits key lengths
      - Twofish = 128-bit blocks, 128,192, 256 bits lengths
    4) RC4 - WEP, WPA, SSL, TLS
    5) Cipher modes - ECB mode, CBC mode, Counter mode
      * Counter mode allows block ciphers to act more like stream ciphers
      % CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode feeds the ciphertext of the previous block into the encryption of the next block, 
        ensuring that identical plaintext blocks encrypt to different ciphertext blocks when the preceding ciphertext block is different.
      % Counter mode (CTR) encrypts successive values of a "counter" and uses this to encrypt the plaintext, 
        meaning it does not depend on the previous encrypted block for the next block's encryption.
