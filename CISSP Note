1. Security and Risk Management
  A. Security Fundamentals
    1) The five pillars of information security
    2) Confidentiality - sensitive information, encryption, steganography
    3) Integrity - Hash, changes in hash values, digital signatures (Authenticity, Non-repudiation), digital certificates
    4) Availability - patching
    5) Authenticity and nonrepudiation - physical signature, digital signature, bio-security, video surveillance
  B. Security Governance
    1) Aligning security with the business - security leader, business leader, security professionals  *unbalanced decisions
    2) Organizational processes
    3) Security roles and responsibilities - Due Care (legal responsibilities), Due Diligence (reasonable measures), 
    4) Control and risk frameworks 
        - COBIT (Control Objectives for IT, Audit), ISO Standards (IT control), NIST 800-53, NIST RMF (800-37), FedRAMP, SABSA
        While COBIT focuses more on aligning IT management with business objectives and governance,
        ISO standards provide specific requirements for maintaining information security management quality and consistency across industries globally.

      * Policy, standards, and procedures are mandatory. Guidelines are optional
    2) Security Policies
  E. Business Continuity
    1) Business continuity planning - BIA (Business Impact Assessment, identifies and prioritizes)    
      * BCP is also known as continuity of operations planning (COOP), BCP in the cloud is a partnership between providers and customers
    2) Business continuity controls - Single Point of Failure Analysis, Contingency Plan
    3) High availability (Multi-system, minimal interrupt) and fault tolerance (Single system) - load balancing (work evenly)
        Component redundancy - such as power supply or fan
        clustering - all active working
        RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks) = Disk mirroring (RAID 1), Disk Striping (RAID 5)
        * RAID is a fault-tolerance technique, not a backup state
  F. Personnel Security
    1) Personnel security - strong security policy, insider threat
    2) Security in the hiring process - Employment Agreements, NDAs
    3) Employee termination process - Exit interview, Revoke Access Promptly
    4) Employee privacy - minimization, limit access, encryption, masking (hiding)
    5) Social networking - multi-factoring
  G. Risk Management
    1) Risk analysis, assessment, and scope    * Threat vectors are the specific methods that threats use to exploit a vulnerability
    2) Quantitative risk assessment 
      - single risk and asset pair, Asset Value(AV), Exposure Factor(EF), Single-Loss Expectancy(SLE)
      - AV * EF = SLE
      - Annualized Rate of Occurrence(ARO), Annualized Loss Expectancy(ALE),
      - SLE * ARO = ALE
      * Be prepared to work through a quantitative risk assessment calculation on the exam
      - Mean Time to Failure(MTTF), Mean Time Between Failure(MTBF), Mean Time to Repair(MTTR)
    3) Risk treatment - Inherent Risk => controls applied => residual risk + control risk, Expansionary/Neutral/Conservative

    2) Data security policies
      - Data classification, Data Lifecycle Policy (Retention, Disposal)
    3) Data security roles
      - Data Owner(business leaders) > Steward(handling day to day) > Custodian(IT staff members) > User
      - Data Subject(collected data), Data processors(third parties)
      * GDPR uses the term data controller instead of data owner
      * System ownership and data ownership are two different concepts
    4) Limiting data collection
      - Minimize information collected, Monitor Third Parties
    5) The data lifecycle

    2) Leveraging industry standards
    3) Customizing security standards
    4) Cloud storage security
      - Encryption, Access control
    5) Information classification

3. Security Architecture and Engineering
  A. Secure Design
    1) Secure design principles
      - Fail open, Fail secure
      % Network segmentation involves dividing a network into smaller parts to improve security and manageability, 
        but it doesn't directly prevent programs from accessing each other.
      % Process isolation is a security measure that ensures different programs run separately,
        preventing them from accessing or interfering with each other.
    2) Security models
      - Bell-LaPadula Model(confidentiality, No read up, no write down), Biba Model(integrity, no read down, no write up)
      * The Bell-LaPadula model is rarely implemented outside of military applications
      * The Bell-LaPadula model and Biba models are important for the exam but rarely used in the real world
    3) Security evaluation models
      - TCSEC, Common Criteria, Certification and Accreditation(ATO, IATO, IATT, DATO)
      * Certification and accreditation are different. Accreditation and authorization are the same.
    4) Segregation of duties
      % Segregation of duties is the principle that ensures no individual has access to multiple permissions
        that would allow them to perform a highly sensitive action alone, preventing fraud and errors.
      % Two-person control is a security measure that requires at least two authorized individuals to perform certain actions,
        ensuring that no single person can complete sensitive tasks alone.
    5) Privacy by design
      (1) Proactive preventive
      (2) Privacy as the Default Setting
      (3) Privacy Embedded into Design
      (4) Full Functionality
      (5) End to End security
      (6) Visibility and Transparency
      (7) Respect for User Privacy
    6) Secure defaults
      - Keep It Simple and Small
    7) Information system lifecycle
  B. Virtualization and Cloud Computing
    1) What is the cloud?
    2) Cloud computing roles
      - Cloud Access Security Broker(CASB)
    3) Drivers for cloud computing
      - On-demand self-service, Scalability, Elasticity, Broad Network Access, Measured Service
    4) Security service providers
      * MSSPs(Managed Security Service Providers) may also be referred to as security as a service (SECaaS)
      - Network-based CASB, API-Based CASB
    5) Multitenant computing
      - Oversubscription, Resource Pooling
    6) Virtualization
      - Type 1, Type 2(Operating system, personal device), VM Sprawl
      % Type 1 hypervisor is known as bare metal and runs on top of bare hardware.
      % Type 2 hypervisor is known as hosted and runs on top of an operating system.
    7) Desktop and application virtualization
      - VDI(Virtual Desktop Infrastructure), Application Virtualization
    8) Cloud compute resources
    9) Containerization
      - Applications are what containerized computing environments are created for.
      % A hypervisor is not part of containerization. A hypervisor is an application where you can create, manage, and run multiple VMs.
    10) Cloud activities and the cloud reference architecture
      - ISO/IEC 17789:2014
      * Reference architectures provide a useful framework, but they're just a starting point.
    11) Cloud deployment models
      * No cloud model is inherently superior to the other approaches. It all depends on the context.
      % Vertical scaling adds more resources to existing servers to meet demand.
      % Horizontal scaling adds more servers to the pool to meet increased demand.
    12) Cloud service categories
      - XaaS, SaaS(entire app / Data), PaaS(app platform / Data, Application), IaaS(Servers/storage / Data, Application, OS), FaaS(serverless computing)
      * Understanding the shared responsibility model is crucial for cybersecurity professionals.
