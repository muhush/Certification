      - AV * EF = SLE
      - Annualized Rate of Occurrence(ARO), Annualized Loss Expectancy(ALE),
      - SLE * ARO = ALE
      * Be prepared to work through a quantitative risk assessment calculation on the exam
      % The annualized loss expectancy (ALE) is the best metric to compare relative risks because it incorporates both the likelihood and the impact of those risks.

    2) Data security policies
      - Data classification, Data Lifecycle Policy (Retention, Disposal)
    3) Data security roles
      - Data Owner(business leaders) > Steward(handling day to day) > Custodian(IT staff members) > User
      % A data controller decides what data to process and how it is processed.
      - Data Subject(collected data), Data processors(third parties)
      * GDPR uses the term data controller instead of data owner
      * System ownership and data ownership are two different concepts
    4) Limiting data collection
      - Minimize information collected, Monitor Third Parties
    5) The data lifecycle
      - Create, Store, Use, Share, Archive, Destroy
      - Clearing(Casual), Purging(advanced), Destroying
      % Purging writes a series of 1s and 0s over media multiple times, and it removes all data remnants.
  B. Data Security Controls

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Security Architecture and Engineering
  A. Secure Design
    1) Secure design principles
      - Fail open, Fail secure
      % Network segmentation involves dividing a network into smaller parts to improve security and manageability, 
        but it doesn't directly prevent programs from accessing each other.
      % Process isolation is a security measure that ensures different programs run separately,
        preventing them from accessing or interfering with each other.
    2) Security models
      - Bell-LaPadula Model(confidentiality, No read up, no write down), Biba Model(integrity, no read down, no write up)
      * The Bell-LaPadula model is rarely implemented outside of military applications
      * The Bell-LaPadula model and Biba models are important for the exam but rarely used in the real world
    3) Security evaluation models
      - TCSEC, Common Criteria, Certification and Accreditation(ATO, IATO, IATT, DATO)
      * Certification and accreditation are different. Accreditation and authorization are the same.
      % Security targets (STs) specify the claims of security from the vendor that are built into a target of evaluation (TOE).
    4) Segregation of duties
      % Segregation of duties is the principle that ensures no individual has access to multiple permissions
        that would allow them to perform a highly sensitive action alone, preventing fraud and errors.
      % Two-person control is a security measure that requires at least two authorized individuals to perform certain actions,
        ensuring that no single person can complete sensitive tasks alone.
    5) Privacy by design
      (1) Proactive preventive
      (2) Privacy as the Default Setting
      (3) Privacy Embedded into Design
      (4) Full Functionality

      - VDI(Virtual Desktop Infrastructure), Application Virtualization
    8) Cloud compute resources
    9) Containerization
      - Applications are what containerized computing environments are created for.
      % A hypervisor is not part of containerization. A hypervisor is an application where you can create, manage, and run multiple VMs.
    10) Cloud activities and the cloud reference architecture
      - ISO/IEC 17789:2014
      * Reference architectures provide a useful framework, but they're just a starting point.
    11) Cloud deployment models
      * No cloud model is inherently superior to the other approaches. It all depends on the context.
      % Vertical scaling adds more resources to existing servers to meet demand.
      % Horizontal scaling adds more servers to the pool to meet increased demand.
    12) Cloud service categories
      - XaaS, SaaS(entire app / Data), PaaS(app platform / Data, Application), IaaS(Servers/storage / Data, Application, OS), FaaS(serverless computing)
      * Understanding the shared responsibility model is crucial for cybersecurity professionals.
    13) Edge and fog computing
      % In edge computing, the intelligence and processing are contained within each device. Thus, rather than having to send data off to a master processing entity,
        each device can process its own data locally.
      % Fog computing relies on sensors, IoT devices, or even edge computing devices to collect data and then transfer it back to a central location for processing.
  C. Hardware Security
    1) Memory protection
      - Segmentation Fault, Memory Leak
      % Write blockers are hardware devices used to prevent the accidental writing of data to media that was collected as evidence.

        without having to be directly programmed for interaction with each type.
    2) NoSQL databases
    3) Distributed and high-performance computing
      - Large-Scale Parallel Data, Grid Computing, Peer-to-peer Computing(Tor)
      % Grid computing utilizes the unused processing power of multiple computers across different locations,
        combining them to form a virtual supercomputer that is managed by a centralized controller.

    5) Cryptographic math
      - Exclusive Or(XOR), 
      - Confusion, Defusion, Obfuscation
    6) Choosing encryption algorithms
       * Don't try to build your own encryption algorithm unless you really know what you're doing
    7) The perfect encryption algorithm
       - One-Time pad
       % Securely exchanging the pads is essential for the security of one-time pad operations, 
         as interception by a third party could compromise the security of the encrypted messages.
       % Using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) in conjunction with the one-time pad is not critical to the security of one-time pad operations,
         as the one-time pad's security is already absolute if implemented correctly.
    8) The cryptographic lifecycle
  G. Symmetric Cryptography
    1) Data encryption standard(DES) - 64bit blocks, 54bit length
    2) 3DES
      * Double DES is no more secure than standard DES, due to the meet-in-the-middle attack
      - 64-bit block, 112-bit length
    3) AES, Blowfish, and Twofish
      - Rihndael algorithm, 128-bit blocks, 128, 192, 256 bits lengths
      - Blowfish = 64 bit blocks, 32~448 bits key lengths
      - Twofish = 128-bit blocks, 128,192, 256 bits lengths
    4) RC4 - WEP, WPA, SSL, TLS
    5) Cipher modes - ECB mode, CBC mode, Counter mode
      * Counter mode allows block ciphers to act more like stream ciphers
      % CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode feeds the ciphertext of the previous block into the encryption of the next block, 
        ensuring that identical plaintext blocks encrypt to different ciphertext blocks when the preceding ciphertext block is different.
      % Counter mode (CTR) encrypts successive values of a "counter" and uses this to encrypt the plaintext, 
        meaning it does not depend on the previous encrypted block for the next block's encryption.
    6) Steganography
  H. Asymmetric Cryptography
    1) Rivest-Shamir-Adelman(RSA)
      * Users create RSA key pairs using two large prime numbers.
    2) PGP and GnuPG

    3) Elliptic curve and quantum cryptography
      * You won't need to know the details of ECC. Remember that it doesn't use prime factorization.
      % Elliptic curve cryptography relies on the difficulty of the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem,
        which quantum algorithms can solve more efficiently than classical algorithms.
  I. Key management
    1) Key management practices
    2) Key exchange - Out-of-band key exchange, in-band key exchange(Diffie-Hellman)
    3) Diffie-hellman - Symmetric
      % The difficulty of solving the discrete logarithm problem provides the security underlying the Diffie-Hellman algorithm.
    4) Key escrow - Recovery Agents
      % The clipper chip performed encryption, but it included a special law enforcement access field, or LEAF, value that allowed government agents to access the content of the communication.
    5) Key stretching - Salting, Hashing, PBKDF2 (Password-based key Derivation Function v2), bcryypt(blowfish)
    6) Hardware security modules(HSM)
  J. Public Key Infrastructure
    1) Trust models - Asymmetric Cryptography, Web of Trust(WOT)
    2) PKI and digital certificates
      - CA(Certificate Authority)
      % The certificate owner can self-sign their own certificate. However, self-signed certificates may be used only internally and are not considered valid on the Internet.
      % The certificate authority (CA) digitally signs applicant certificates with the CA's digital signature.
    3) Hash functions - MD5, SHA(Federal Computer), RIPEMD(government-sponsored)
      % The SHA-2 hash function produces hashes of 224, 256, or 512 bits.
    4) Digital signatures 
      - Authentication(signed message), Integrity(not alter), Non-reputation(prove third party)
      - Collision-resistant, Asymmetric

      % DSA is no longer an acceptable implementation of digital signatures in the federal government under FIPS 186-5.
    6) Created a digital certificate
    7) Revoke a digital certificate - CRL(Certificate Revocation List), OCSP(Online Certificate Status Protocol)
      % The most effective method of revoking digital certificates is through the interactive OCSP responder.
      % Utilizing certificate revocation lists for revoking digital certificates is a manual process with inherent delays.
    8) Certificate stapling
      - Helping future visits for 24 hours
      % Certificate stapling involves a server sending a timestamped OCSP response to prove a certificate's validity
        but does not indicate that a certificate is unlikely to change over time.
    9) Certificate authorities
      - Self-Signed certificates, Offline CAs
      % The root CA is an offline CA that is used only to sign the certificates of intermediate CAs belonging to the same organization.
      % Internal CA refers to a certificate authority within an organization, which could be online or offline depending on its role,
        but is not specifically categorized as typically offline.
    10) Certificate subjects
      * You may find exam questions that discuss certificate object identifiers (OIDs).
      - Servers(SSH), Devices, Individuals, Developers(code signing)
      - Certificate Pinning
      % Certificate pinning is used to tell clients that a certificate, or its public key, is unlikely to change over time.
        It helps in preventing man-in-the-middle attacks by ensuring that the client accepts only a specific certificate or public key.
    11) Certificate types
      - Root Certificates, Wildcard Certificates
      - Domain validation(DV), organizational validation(OV), extended validation(EV, highest)
    12) Certificate formats
      - DER(Distinguished Encoding Rules), PEM(Privacy Enhanced Mail)
      * CRT files may be either DER binary certificates or PEM text certificates.
      - PFX(Personal Information Exchange), P7B
      % The PFX format is most closely associated with Windows systems that store certificates in binary format, whereas the P7B format is used for Windows systems storing files in text format.
  K. Cryptanalytic Attacks
    1) Brute-force attacks
    2) Knowledge-based attacks
      - Frequency Analysis
      * You won't need to perform cryptanalysis on the exam. You just need to know the different techniques.
      % Frequency analysis attack involves statistical analysis of ciphertext to detect patterns that might reveal the underlying plaintext,
        exploiting the fact that certain letters or combinations appear more frequently in a language.
      - Chosen Plaintext Attack
      % Chosen plaintext attack allows the attacker to encrypt plaintexts of their choosing, gaining information to decrypt other messages 
        or deduce the encryption key, rather than analyzing ciphertext for patterns.
      % Chosen ciphertext attacks require access to the algorithm and work by having the attacker perform encryption that results in an expected ciphertext.
    3) Eavesdropping attacks - Man-in-the-middle attack, Replay attack, SSL Stripping
    4) Implementation attacks - Fault Injection Attack, Side-channel attack, Timing attack
      % Fault injection attacks compromise the integrity of a cryptographic device by causing some type of external fault, such as the application of high-voltage electricity.
      % Implementation attacks rely on flaws in the cryptographic algorithm.

      % Network Address Translation-Protocol Translation (NAT-PT) (RFC-2766) can be used to convert between IPv4 and IPv6 network segments similar to how NAT converts between internal and external addresses.
    2) Subnetting - Subnet Masks
    3) Security zones - Zero Trust, Extranet, Honeynet, Ad Hoc Network(Temporary)
      % A network firewall is a security solution that can be used to separate a network into three distinct security zones.
      % A screened subnet is a type of security zone that can be positioned so that it operates as a buffer network between the secured private network and the internet and can host publicly accessible services.
    4) Isolating sensitive systems 
      - Network Segmentation
      * Physically isolated systems are called "air-gapped" systems.
      - Jump Server
      * Jump servers, jump boxes, and jump hosts are all the same thing.
    5) VLANs and logical segmentation - VRF(Virtual Routing and Forwarding), Virtual Domain, Network Overlays, Encapsulation
      % LiFi (Light Fidelity) uses light to transmit data wirelessly,

    6) Security device placement
    7) Software defined networking(SDN)
    8) Transmission media - VPC, SDV
    9) Cloud networking
    10) Zero trust and SASE
  C. Network Security Design
    1) Routers, switches, and bridges
      % A switch operates primarily at layer 2 of the OSI model, handling data frames between devices on the same local area network (LAN).
      % A router operates mainly at layer 3, routing data packets between different networks based on IP addresses.
    2) Network topologies
    3) Transport architecture
      % Configuring devices, monitoring performance, and troubleshooting problems are tasks associated with the management plane,
        which oversees and manages the network.
      % The control plane is responsible for making decisions about where data should flow through the network,
        using protocols to determine the best path for data packets.
    4) Firewalls - Stateful Inspection, Implicit Deny
      * You need to understand the default/implicit deny principle of firewalls.
      % The implicit deny principle ensures that access to an object is denied unless access has been expressly allowed (or explicitly granted) to a subject.
    5) Proxy servers - Forward Proxies, Reverse Proxies, Transparent Proxies
    6) Load balancers - Autoscaling, Round-Robin Scheduling, Session Persistence
    7) VPNs and VPN concentrators - IPsec(Layer 3, L2TP), TCP Port 443
      * Split-tunnel VPNs provide users with a false sense of security
    8) Network intrusion detection and prevention
      * Anomaly detection, behavior-based detection, and heuristic detection are the same thing.
      % Anomaly detection identifies unusual patterns that may indicate a security incident,
        based on statistical analysis, without frequent specific threat updates.
      % Signature detection relies on a database of known threat signatures and requires 
        frequent updates from the vendor to recognize new threats.
    9) Protocol analyzers - tcpdump, tcpreplay
    10) Unified threat management
    11) Content distribution networks(CDNs)
  D. Network Security Techniques
    1) Restricting network access 
      - Perimeter security, Network Access Control
      - Rule based, role based, time based, location based
    2) Network access control - EAP(Supplicant), RADIUS (Authentication Server)
      % The network access server is the client within a RADIUS architecture.
    3) Firewall rule management
      % A shadowed rule happens when an earlier rule in the firewall's rule set matches traffic that a later rule was intended to match,
        rendering the later rule ineffective.
      % An orphaned rule occurs when a service is decommissioned but the related firewall rules are not removed,
        leaving unused or unnecessary rules.
    4) Router configuration security
      * You won't need to know the syntax of router access control list commands.
    5) Switch configuration security - VLAN Pruning, VLAN Trunk Negotiation, Port Security, DHCP Snooping
    6) Maintaining network availability - Flooding Attack, Flood Guard Technology, Routing Loops, Spanning Tree Protocol(STP), BPDU Guard
    7) Network monitoring - Network Flow data
    8) Firewall and network logs - SIEM
    9) Network performance metrcis - Latency, Jitter
    10) SNMP
      * Use SNMPv3. Earlier versions have critical security flaws.
      % GetRequest messages are used by a network management system to request information from an SNMP agent.
      % SetRequest messages are used by a network management system to change a value on an SNMP agent.
      % Response messages are sent by an SNMP agent to a network management system in reply to GetRequests and SetRequests, not to report unusual events.
      % Trap can an SNMP agent send to a network management system to report an unusual event
    11) Deception technologies - Darknets, DNS Sinkhole
      % Using a DNS sinkhole, an admin can forward malicious DNS requests to another IP address to keep from harm.
    12) Network support - SLA
  E. Specialized Networking
    1) Telephony - VoIP
    2) Multimedia collaboration - XMPP
    3) Storage networks
      % Fibre Channel requires the use of dedicated connections and is known for its high speed and reliability in connecting computer data storage to servers.
  F. Transport Encryption
    1) TLS and SSL
      * TLS depends upon pairings of encryption and hash functions known as cipher suites.
      * Session keys are also known as ephemeral keys.
    2) IPsec
      - ESP(Encapsulating Security Payload, Confidentiality), Authentication Header(AH, Integrity)
      - SA(Security Association)
      - Older Linux systems used telnet for remote access
    3) Remote network access
  G. Wireless Networking
    1) Understanding wireless networking
      * Wi-Fi signals travel over open airwaves and are subject to undetectable interception!
    2) Wireless encryption
      % WPA3 uses Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) for key exchange,
        providing enhanced protection against offline dictionary attacks compared to its predecessors.
      % TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol) was used in WPA for encryption but has been phased out
        in favor of more secure methods like CCMP and does not involve key exchange.
      % CCMP (Counter Mode Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol) is an encryption protocol
        used in Wi-Fi security for data confidentiality and is not specifically a key exchange mechanism.
    3) Wireless authentication - Captive portals
      * Make sure you understand the security status of the specific EAP variants in use on your network.
    4) Wireless signal propagation - Omnidirectional, Directional, Site survey
      % Beam forming uses multiple antennas to detect the location of a device connecting to the wireless access point
        and then steers the signal in the direction of that device.
      % Pulse modulation refers to a method of encoding information in a signal, rather than focusing wireless signals towards devices.
    5) Wireless networking equipment - Fat Access Points, Wi-Fi Analyzer
      % A wireless controller manages configurations, optimizes performance, and reduces interference among APs in wireless networks.
      % Fat AP refers to an access point with built-in intelligence for handling data processing but does not manage or optimize multiple APs.
  H. Mobile Device Security
    1) Mobile connection methods - Cellular Networks, Wi-Fi Networks, NFC, Bluetooth(30 feet)
    2) Mobile device security
    3) Mobile device management(MDM)
    4) Mobile device tracking
    5) Mobile application security
    6) Mobile security enforcement
      % Sideloading refers to the process of installing apps on a device from sources other than the official app store.
      % Jailbreaking is the process of removing software restrictions imposed by iOS on devices by Apple, allowing the installation of unauthorized apps,
        but does not specifically refer to the act of installing apps outside of the App Store.
    7) Bring your own device (BYOD)
    8) Mobile deployment models
  I. Host Security
    1) Operating system security - System Hardening
    2) Malware prevention
      - Viruses, Worms, Trojan Horses, Spyware
      - Protection = Sandboxing(isolates)
      - Spam Filtering
    3) Application management
      * While the terms whitelisting and blacklisting are problematic, you should still know them for the exam.
      % BitLocker is a full disk encryption feature designed to protect data by providing encryption for entire volumes.
      % BitControl does not exist as an application control technology in Microsoft Windows.
      % App control is a general term for technologies that manage or restrict application usage, but it is not a specific built-in feature of Windows.
      % AppLocker is the application control technology built-in to Microsoft Windows
    4) Host-based network security controls
      * Granting network access requires configuring both network and host firewalls.
      % Host firewall is a built-in feature of Microsoft Windows designed to block unauthorized access to or from private networks.
    5) File integrity monitoring(FIM)
      % Tripwire is a file integrity monitoring tool
      % Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (MECM), formerly known as SCCM, is used for managing large groups of computers,
        focusing on configuration management rather than file integrity monitoring.

5. Identity and Access Management (IAM)
  A. Identification
    1) Authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA)
      * Remember that identification and authentication are separate and distinct steps!
      % Authorization limits user activity to actions they are permitted to perform, following the principle of least privilege.
      % Authentication verifies that a user is who they claim to be.
    2) Usernames and access cards
    3) Biometrics - Low false
      % FAR measures the frequency at which unauthorized users are inadvertently admitted.
      % FRR measures the frequency at which legitimate users are denied access to a system or facility.
    4) Registration and identity proofing
      - Request, Approval, Identity proofing, Issuance
  B. Authentication
    1) Authentication factors
      - Something you know, Something you are, Something you have
      - False Acceptance, False Rejection
    2) Multifactor authentication
    3) Something you have
      % An authentication token that requires a button to be pushed each time to receive a token is based on HOTP.
    4) Password authentication protocols (PAP) - CHAP (Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol)
    5) Single sign-on and federation
      % Federated Identity Management (FIM) is best to implement when you have accounts across multiple service providers with whom you would like to share identity information.
        With FIM, you can use one login to access resources you've been authorized throughout the federation.
    6) RADIUS - Centralized approach
      * Remember that a RADIUS client is usually an application server!
      % RADIUS typically uses UDP, which is less reliable than TCP, and does not fully encrypt the authentication session, only the password.
      % TACACS is the original version of the protocol and is less sophisticated compared to TACACS+, lacking full encryption and the use of TCP for reliable communications.
      % TACACS+ is an authentication protocol that fully encrypts the authentication session, uses the reliable TCP protocol and will work on Cisco devices.
    7) Kerberos and LDAP 
      - Kerberos = core protocols for MS Active directory, Port 88
      - LDAP = port 389, Port 636
      - NTLM
      % TGT includes information about the client and a copy of the client TGS session key.
      % When a client wishes to access a service, the client contacts the TGS.
      % The AS looks up the user in its database and retrieves the user's password. It performs authentication of the end user.
    8) SAML - Security Assertion Markup Langauge
    9) Identity as a service (IDaaS) - Directory Integration, Application Integration
    10) OAuth and OpenID Connect
      % OAuth is an authorization protocol, but not an authentication protocol.
    11) Certificate-based authentication
    12) Passwordless authentication - Key-Based Authentication
  C. Accountability
    1) Accountability - Logs must be secure
    2) Session management - Timeouts
  D. Account Management
    1) Understand account and privilege management - Least Privilege, Segregation of Duties, Job Rotation, Mandatory Vacation
    2) Account types - User Account, Privileged Account, Shared Account, Service Account
      * Avoid the use of shared/generic accounts and credentials.
    3) Account policies - Group Policy Object(GPO)
    4) Password policies
      * Current NIST guidance says that passwords should not expire.
    5) Manage roles
      % A security group assigns users to roles within his Windows enterprise, as it allows for the grouping of user accounts, computer accounts,
        and other security groups into manageable units for assigning permissions and access rights.
      % A Distribution group is used primarily in email applications to send messages to groups of users and is not designed for assigning roles or managing permissions.
    6) Account monitoring - Inaccurate Permissions, Attestation, Unauthorized Use, Geotagging, Geofencing
    7) Provisioning and de-provisioning - Privilege Creep
  E. Authorization
    1) Understand authorization - Least Privilege, Account Review
      * Be able to identify least privilege and segregation of duties issues in a scenario
    2) Mandatory access controls (MAC)
    3) Discretionary access controls (DAC)
      % In a discretionary access control system, individual users have the ability to alter access permissions.
    4) Access control lists
    5) Database access control - SQL Server Authentication, Windows Authentication, Mixed Authentication
    6) Advanced authorization concepts - RBAC, ABAC, location-based control, Time-of-Day Restriction
      * Risk-based access controls apply stronger standards in situations posing greater risk.
  F. Access Control Attacks
    1) Social engineering - Authority and Trust, Intimidation(Sharing), Consensus/Social Proof, Scarcity, Urgency, Familiarity/Liking
    2) Impersonation attacks - Spam, Phishing, Spear Phishing, Whaling, Pharming, Vishing, Smishing and SPIM, Spoofing, Brand Impersonation
    3) identity fraud and pretexting - Pretexting Attacks
      % In a pretexting attack, the attacker contacts a third-party company pretending to be the consumer and attempts to gain access to that consumer's account.
    4) Watering hole attacks
      % Watering hole attacks use sneaky techniques to lure unsuspecting users and infect their systems with malware. They use commonly visited sites without the website owner's knowledge.
    5) Physical social engineering - Shoulder surfing, Dumpster Diving, Tailgating
