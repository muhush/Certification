1. Security and Risk Management
  a. Security Fundamentals
    1) The five pillars of information security
    2) Confidentiality - sensitive information, encryption, steganography
    3) Integrity - Hash, changes in hash values, digital signatures (Authenticity, Non-repudiation), digital certificates
    4) Availability - patching
    5) Authenticity and nonrepudiation - physical signature, digital signature, bio-security, video surveillance
  b. Security Governance
    1) Aligning security with the business - security leader, business leader, security professionals  *unbalanced decisions
    2) Organizational processes
    3) Security roles and responsibilities - Due Care (legal responsibilities), Due Diligence (reasonable measures), 
    4) Control and risk frameworks - COBIT (Control Objectives for IT, Audit), ISO Standards (IT control), NIST 800-53, NIST RMF (800-37), FedRAMP, SABSA
        While COBIT focuses more on aligning IT management with business objectives and governance,
        ISO standards provide specific requirements for maintaining information security management quality and consistency across industries globally.
