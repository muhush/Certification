3. Security Architecture and Engineering
  A. Secure Design
    1) Secure design principles
      - Fail open, Fail secure
      % Network segmentation involves dividing a network into smaller parts to improve security and manageability, 
        but it doesn't directly prevent programs from accessing each other.
      % Process isolation is a security measure that ensures different programs run separately,
        preventing them from accessing or interfering with each other.
    2) Security models
      - Bell-LaPadula Model(confidentiality, No read up, no write down), Biba Model(integrity, no read down, no write up)
      * The Bell-LaPadula model is rarely implemented outside of military applications
      * The Bell-LaPadula model and Biba models are important for the exam but rarely used in the real world
    3) Security evaluation models
      - TCSEC, Common Criteria, Certification and Accreditation(ATO, IATO, IATT, DATO)
      * Certification and accreditation are different. Accreditation and authorization are the same.
    4) Segregation of duties
      % Segregation of duties is the principle that ensures no individual has access to multiple permissions
        that would allow them to perform a highly sensitive action alone, preventing fraud and errors.
      % Two-person control is a security measure that requires at least two authorized individuals to perform certain actions,
        ensuring that no single person can complete sensitive tasks alone.
    5) Privacy by design
      (1) Proactive preventive
      (2) Privacy as the Default Setting
      (3) Privacy Embedded into Design
      (4) Full Functionality
      (5) End to End security
      (6) Visibility and Transparency
      (7) Respect for User Privacy
    6) Secure defaults
      - Keep It Simple and Small
    7) Information system lifecycle

    7) Desktop and application virtualization
      - VDI(Virtual Desktop Infrastructure), Application Virtualization
    8) Cloud compute resources
    9) Containerization
      - Applications are what containerized computing environments are created for.
      % A hypervisor is not part of containerization. A hypervisor is an application where you can create, manage, and run multiple VMs.
    10) Cloud activities and the cloud reference architecture
      - ISO/IEC 17789:2014
      * Reference architectures provide a useful framework, but they're just a starting point.
    11) Cloud deployment models
      * No cloud model is inherently superior to the other approaches. It all depends on the context.
      % Vertical scaling adds more resources to existing servers to meet demand.
      % Horizontal scaling adds more servers to the pool to meet increased demand.
    12) Cloud service categories
      - XaaS, SaaS(entire app / Data), PaaS(app platform / Data, Application), IaaS(Servers/storage / Data, Application, OS), FaaS(serverless computing)

        combining them to form a virtual supercomputer that is managed by a centralized controller.
  E. Embedded Systems Security
    1) Industrial control systems and operational technology
      - SCADA(Remote Central), DCS(Controlling processes), PLC
      % SCADA is used to gather information from remote sensors via telemetry.
      % Distributed Control System (DCS) is used to control industrial processes.
      % Programmable Logic Controller (PLCs) is a device used to monitor and control industrial equipment.
    2) Internet of things
    3) Securing smart devices
      - Firmware Version Control, Security Wrapper
    4) Secure networking for smart devices

    6) Communications for embedded devices
  F. Encryption
    1) Understanding encryption
    2) Symmetric and asymmetric cryptography
      - Symmetric(same key), Asymmetric(different key, public, private)
      * Keys used to encrypt and decrypt using asymmetric cryptography must be from the same pair
    3) Goals and cryptography
      - Confidentiality, Integrity, Authentication, Obfuscation(hiding), Non-Repudiation
    4) Codes and ciphers
      * Codes and ciphers are related concepts, but you should know the difference when you take the exam
      - Stream Ciphers, Block Ciphers
    5) Cryptographic math
      - Exclusive Or(XOR), 
      - Confusion, Defusion, Obfuscation
    6) Choosing encryption algorithms
       * Don't try to build your own encryption algorithm unless you really know what you're doing
    7) The perfect encryption algorithm
       - One-Time pad
       % Securely exchanging the pads is essential for the security of one-time pad operations, 
         as interception by a third party could compromise the security of the encrypted messages.
       % Using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) in conjunction with the one-time pad is not critical to the security of one-time pad operations,
         as the one-time pad's security is already absolute if implemented correctly.
    8) The cryptographic lifecycle
  G. Symmetric Cryptography
    1) Data encryption standard(DES) - 64bit blocks, 54bit length
    2) 3DES
      * Double DES is no more secure than standard DES, due to the meet-in-the-middle attack
      - 64-bit block, 112-bit length
    3) AES, Blowfish, and Twofish
      - Rihndael algorithm, 128-bit blocks, 128, 192, 256 bits lengths
      - Blowfish = 64 bit blocks, 32~448 bits key lengths
      - Twofish = 128-bit blocks, 128,192, 256 bits lengths
    4) RC4 - WEP, WPA, SSL, TLS
    5) Cipher modes - ECB mode, CBC mode, Counter mode
      * Counter mode allows block ciphers to act more like stream ciphers
      % CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode feeds the ciphertext of the previous block into the encryption of the next block, 
        ensuring that identical plaintext blocks encrypt to different ciphertext blocks when the preceding ciphertext block is different.
      % Counter mode (CTR) encrypts successive values of a "counter" and uses this to encrypt the plaintext, 
        meaning it does not depend on the previous encrypted block for the next block's encryption.
    6) Steganography
  H. Asymmetric Cryptography
    1) Rivest-Shamir-Adelman(RSA)
      * Users create RSA key pairs using two large prime numbers.
    2) PGP and GnuPG
      - Pretty Good Privacy, Open PGP, Combine Sym and Asym
      % A randomly generated symmetric key is used to encrypt the contents of a message when using PGP.
      - GPG
    3) Elliptic curve and quantum cryptography
      * You won't need to know the details of ECC. Remember that it doesn't use prime factorization.
      % Elliptic curve cryptography relies on the difficulty of the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem,
        which quantum algorithms can solve more efficiently than classical algorithms.
  I. Key management
    1) Key management practices
    2) Key exchange - Out-of-band key exchange, in-band key exchange(Diffie-Hellman)
    3) Diffie-hellman - Symmetric
      % The difficulty of solving the discrete logarithm problem provides the security underlying the Diffie-Hellman algorithm.
    4) Key escrow - Recovery Agents
      % The clipper chip performed encryption, but it included a special law enforcement access field, 
        or LEAF, value that allowed government agents to access the content of the communication.
    5) Key stretching - Salting, Hashing, PBKDF2 (Password-based key Derivation Function v2), bcryypt(blowfish)
    6) Hardware security modules(HSM)
  J. Public Key Infrastructure
    1) Trust models - Asymmetric Cryptography, Web of Trust(WOT)
    2) PKI and digital certificates
      - CA(Certificate Authority)
      % The certificate owner can self-sign their own certificate. 
        However, self-signed certificates may be used only internally and are not considered valid on the Internet.
      % The certificate authority (CA) digitally signs applicant certificates with the CA's digital signature.
    3) Hash functions - MD5, SHA(Federal Computer), RIPEMD(government-sponsored)
      % The SHA-2 hash function produces hashes of 224, 256, or 512 bits.
    4) Digital signatures 
      - Authentication(signed message), Integrity(not alter), Non-reputation(prove third party)
      - Collision-resistant, Asymmetric                    
    5) Digital signature standard
      - RSA, ECDSA, EdDSA
      % DSA is no longer an acceptable implementation of digital signatures in the federal government under FIPS 186-5.
    6) Created a digital certificate
    7) Revoke a digital certificate - CRL(Certificate Revocation List), OCSP(Online Certificate Status Protocol)
      % The most effective method of revoking digital certificates is through the interactive OCSP responder.
      % Utilizing certificate revocation lists for revoking digital certificates is a manual process with inherent delays.
    8) Certificate stapling
      - Helping future visits for 24 hours
      % Certificate stapling involves a server sending a timestamped OCSP response to prove a certificate's validity
        but does not indicate that a certificate is unlikely to change over time.
    9) Certificate authorities
      - Self-Signed certificates, Offline CAs
      % The root CA is an offline CA that is used only to sign the certificates of intermediate CAs belonging to the same organization.
      % Internal CA refers to a certificate authority within an organization, which could be online or offline depending on its role,
        but is not specifically categorized as typically offline.
    10) Certificate subjects
      * You may find exam questions that discuss certificate object identifiers (OIDs).
      - Servers(SSH), Devices, Individuals, Developers(code signing)
      - Certificate Pinning
      % Certificate pinning is used to tell clients that a certificate, or its public key, is unlikely to change over time.
        It helps in preventing man-in-the-middle attacks by ensuring that the client accepts only a specific certificate or public key.
    11) Certificate types
      - Root Certificates, Wildcard Certificates
      - Domain validation(DV), organizational validation(OV), extended validation(EV, highest)
    12) Certificate formats
      - DER(Distinguished Encoding Rules), PEM(Privacy Enhanced Mail)
      * CRT files may be either DER binary certificates or PEM text certificates.
      - PFX(Personal Information Exchange), P7B
  K. Cryptanalytic Attacks
    1) Brute-force attacks
    2) Knowledge-based attacks
      - Frequency Analysis
      * You won't need to perform cryptanalysis on the exam. You just need to know the different techniques.
      % Frequency analysis attack involves statistical analysis of ciphertext to detect patterns that might reveal the underlying plaintext,
        exploiting the fact that certain letters or combinations appear more frequently in a language.
      - Chosen Plaintext Attack
      % Chosen plaintext attack allows the attacker to encrypt plaintexts of their choosing, gaining information to decrypt other messages 
        or deduce the encryption key, rather than analyzing ciphertext for patterns.
    3) Eavesdropping attacks - Man-in-the-middle attack, Replay attack, SSL Stripping
    4) Implementation attacks - Fault Injection Attack, Side-channel attack, Timing attack
    5) Limitations of encryption algorithms
    6) Ransomware - Mimikatz, Countermeasure(Backups, Antimalware)
      * Ransomware is specifically called out in the exam objectives

    4) Power control - Blackouts, Sags, Brownouts, Spikes, Surges
    5) Physical access control - Locks
    6) Visitor management
      % Cameras should always be disclosed to visitors when used as part of physical security controls
        to ensure compliance with privacy laws and regulations.
    7) Physical security personnel - Two-Person Integrity
  M. Software Security Architecture
    1) SOAP and REST 
      - API(Application Programming Interface, AWS, Twitter)
      - SOAP(Simple Object Access Protocol) = XML
      - REST(Representational State Transfer) = HTTPS
    2) SOA and microservices
      - Service-Oriented Architecture
      - Microservices
      % Microservices are fine-grained services that provide small and discrete functions to other services.
